    <h1>Simble Studios Video Server</h1>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p>

      Dave Vedder at Simble Studios approached me to help them create a
      complete system for non-technical users to upload videos from their phone
      and for staff members to be able to view said videos. This project was
      intended for one of their own clients.
    </p>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>

      Since Simble Studios is a software development company, they had the
      technical chops to quickly pin down requirements after just a bit of
      conversation with me. This allowed me to quickly develop a specification
      of the server software I would be providing to them.


    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>

      This project had a few unique requirements:

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

        Uploading users did not have traditional username/password accounts.

        <p>

          The users provided their phone number, and then we sent them an SMS
          message with an authorization code. The users then provided their
          phone number and auth code to authenticate with the system.

        </p>

      </li>
      <li>

        The client required uploaded video files to be encrypted while they
        were on-disk as well as during streaming.

        <p>

          To address this, I developed a system using industry-standard
          encryption while the data was at rest and while it was streaming.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Videos had to be decrypted, encrypted, and encoded "offline".

        <p>

          This means we had to set up a system of worker tasks that processed
          video files and sent notifications to the appropriate people when the
          processing was done.

        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      During the course of this project the requirements changed several times.
      We were able to follow the procedures outlined in my standard contract
      and make the required changes without any drama.

    </p>

    <p>

      In the end we had a functional system with a clean API that Simble
      Studios could use as the backend for the project they were going to
      deliver to their client.

      <p>We were nervous about hiring an outside developer, but it turned out
         that Dustin was easy to work with and helped us solve problems!</p>

      <p>The requirements for our product were in flux, but Dustin easily
         adapted and helped us find solutions to our problems. He also worked
         well with our other developers.</p>
