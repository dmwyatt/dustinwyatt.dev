    <h1>Simble Studios Video Server</h1>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p>

      Dave Vedder at Simble Studios approached me to help them create a
      complete system for non-technical users to upload videos from their phone
      and for staff members to be able to view said videos. This project was
      intended for one of their own clients.
    </p>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>

      Since Simble Studios is a software development company, they had the
      technical chops to quickly pin down requirements after just a bit of
      conversation with me. This allowed me to quickly develop a specification
      of the server software I would be providing to them.


    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>

    <p>
        This project had a few unique requirements. It had to be
      <abbr title="Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act">
        HIPAA</abbr>-compliant, it had to be easy to use for non-tech-savvy
        people, and it had unique authentication requirements.
    </p>

    <p>

      Over the course of this project the requirements changed several times.
      We were able to follow the procedures outlined in my standard contract
      and make the required changes without any drama.

    </p>

    <p>

      In the end we had a functional system with a clean API that Simble
      Studios could use as the backend for the project they were going to
      deliver to their client.

    <blockquote>
      <p>We needed a developer who could work with our existing team and our
         evolving requirements. We knew we needed to move fast, and that can be
         a challenge when bringing on a new developer.</p>

      <p>Dustin was able to get up to speed quickly and begin developing
         something the rest of us could base our work on. On top of that, he
         was professional and pleasant to work with, and exceeded our
         expectations on time and on budget</p>
