        <h3>Diligence Labs Backend</h3>
        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>
          Diligence Labs was interested in backend and frontend work to support
          a large project doing natural language processing and image analysis
          of social media posts. However, they did not have the necessary
          staffing to complete this on the schedule they wanted.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this project was to develop a system to help users
          analyze all of their postings on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to
          help them find content that might be considered objectionable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, the problem to be solved was two-fold. First, I had to
          temporarily integrate with the existing development team. Secondly, I
          had to create the backend for their product.
        </p>

        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <p>
          I worked with their CEO, Dan, as well as one of their developers,
          Dave, to hammer out an overview of requirements for the project. Then,
          I remained in constant communication with the both of them as the
          project progressed and evolved to make sure the code I was delivering
          met their needs.
        </p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>

        <p>
          Since we knew this project was large and had a potential for many
          changes as we worked through it, we agreed to an hourly rate since it
          would be nearly impossible to develop a fixed-price contract. I sent
          invoices to Diligence a couple of times per month.
        </p>

        <p>
          With a lot of collaboration, I delivered a complete backend server
          package to handle the evolving set of requirements.
