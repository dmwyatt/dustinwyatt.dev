        <h1>SMP Maintenance Tracking</h1>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <img
          class="article-img"
          src="../assets/images/smp/maintenance-board.jpg"
          alt="Board of sticky notes."
        />
        <p>
          It was difficult for SMP to keep track of all of the incoming requests
          for maintenance from all the different ways people could submit
          requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making sure all requests were serviced at an appropriate time was
          becoming a big chore.
        </p>

        <p>
          The manager, Anita, reached out to me to talk about how I could help
          them design and implement an online system for tracking all the stages
          of servicing a maintenance request.
        </p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
          After interviewing office staff, maintenance workers, and the owners,
          I wrote up a short overview of a web-based system that would enable
          everyone to keep track of the state of maintenance requests. After
          multiple discussions and revisions we pinned down some exact
          requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          After identifying the problem areas, we settled on a web-based system
          backed up by automated SMS messaging.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>
          At this point it was time to start writing code. I quickly developed
          and deployed a proof of concept for them to begin using. After using
          this for a couple of weeks we were able to identify a couple of areas
          that could use some improvement so I went in and made some changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole system consisted of backend database and code as well as a
          dynamic, full-featured web site.
        </p>
        <p>
          By now, we had created a working system that created confidence that
          maintenance issues were being addressed in a timely and professional
          manner. In the future we hope to expand this system to more areas of
          their business.

          <p>
            Since we're not a technology company we were nervous about hiring a
            developer to help us, but Dustin was a pleasure to work with. He
            answered our questions, helped us ask questions we didn't know we
            needed to ask, and was professional at all times.
