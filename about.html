        Hi, my name is Dustin. I live in Desloge, MO, USA which is a small town
        near St. Louis. I'm married with a 9-year-old daughter. I play video
        games, run, and talk about philosophy and AI on the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started learning to write software on a Tandy "CoCo" TRS-80 when I was
        just a kid by typing BASIC games in from computer magazines. I've been
        doing it for fun and professionally ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early 2000s I had a detour into home-building and I ran my own
        owner-operated construction company (and swung a hammer on the job
        site!). It was here that I best learned how to manage time, manage
        people, and make clients happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since that time I've been writing and designing software. I'm a
        passionate learner and always interested in learning about new
        technologies, while at the same time recognizing the value of
        tried-and-true solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lately I've been experimenting with machine learning and computer vision
        for a variety of tasks. Experiments I'm working on currently:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Training models to see what kind of information we can extract from
          screenshots of people's computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using Raspberry Pi cameras to do presence detection of specific people
          in specific rooms for my home automation system.
        </li>
      </ul>
