        Hi, my name is Dustin. I live in Missouri, USA in a small town near St.
        Louis. I'm married and have a 12-year-old daughter. I work from home,
        travel, and experiment with new technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started learning to write software on a Tandy "CoCo" TRS-80 when I was
        just a kid by typing BASIC games in from computer magazines. I've been
        doing it for fun and professionally ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early 2000s I had a detour into home-building. I ran my own
        design/build construction company (and swung a hammer on the job site!).
        It was here that I best learned how to manage time, manage people, and
        make clients happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even during my construction phase I continued writing and designing
        software. I'm a passionate learner and always interested in learning
        about new technologies. Despite keeping on top of new tech I recognize
        the value of tried-and-true solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lately I've been experimenting with machine learning and computer vision
        for a variety of tasks. Things I'm currently working on in my spare time:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Training models to see what kind of information we can extract from
          screenshots of people's computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using Raspberry Pi cameras to do presence detection of specific people
          in specific rooms for home automation systems.
        </li>
        <li>Building a duplex for rental income. Not technology-related but it's something I'm interested in!</li>
        <li>
          Developing an application for managing backups of Microsoft Windows
          machines.
        </li>
        <li>Designing and building a 3d-printable pen plotter.</li>
      </ul>
